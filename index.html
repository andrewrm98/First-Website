            <h4>Assistant Lead Software Developer; Database specialty</h4>
            <h5>March - May, 2018</h5>
            <h5>Java</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>This course had ten-person student teams working in a class competition to apply Agile development methodologies and software design patterns in Java to create an indoor pathfinding application, map builder, and integrated service request modules for Brigham & Women’s main hospital campus. The software systems that student teams created were to inform Brigham & Women’s Hospital about potential features, user interfaces, or design approaches that they might consider implementing.</li>

                <li>As an assistant lead software engineer, I helped gather software requirements through surveys, interviews, brainstorming, creating user stories, scenarios and storyboards. I was responsible for writing the database components of the application as well as the pathfinding UI. I designed the database subsystem of the application through the creation of UML use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams. I was the technical leader of the entire database subgroup.</li>

                <li>While I worked on the database team, I learned about every aspect of the project through good team communication and helping all teams as assistant lead software developer</li>
                <li>Application was to be run on kiosks placed throughout the hopsital</li>
                <li>Implemented the A* algorithm to determine the shortest path between a given start and end node</li>
                <li>Using Dijkstra's algorithm, users can choose from a list of "quick destinations" like the nearest bathroom or cafeteria</li>
                <li>Users can also login, with a user database, for more functionality</li>
                <li>Users consisted of doctors, patients, nurses, and hospital staff</li>
                <li>Patients can request for help from nurses or hospital staff</li>
                <li>When a patient requests for help, their request is sent to the request database where nurses, doctors, and staff can see the request, fulfill it, and then mark it as completed</li>
                <li>Map builder allows admins to edit, add, and remove nodes quickly and intuitively</li>
                <li>Built a Room Service API that allows admins to keep track of inventory as well as users to request items from the inventory</li>
                <li>Integrated multiple other team's APIs</li>
                <li>Fully rotatable and zoomable map with custom icons</li>

                <li>Our team successfully delivered the requested application at the end of the seven-week term. We were recognized for: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Iteration 3 Best Feature: </strong>Emergency System<br>For this feature we used a server to allow all kiosks to communicate. Specifically, an admin could set every kiosk to "emergency mode" where the path to the nearest exit would be shown. We also used an arduino to create an automatic fire detector that would set off emergency mode if it detected a fire.</li>
                        <li><strong>Iteration4 Best Feature: </strong>Web App<br>For this feature we created a companion web app that allowed admin functionality. The web app was connected with our main database and information was passed between them.</li> </ul> </li>

            </ul>
            <h5>Class Outcome</h5>
            <p>This class taught me much more than any other. Most importantly, learning to work with a large group on a single project was challenging, but in the end I gained project management skills, accountability, work-ethic, and confidence in learning new and daunting skills
            <br/>I also learned a lot about databases, user interfaces, creating more efficient back-ends, designing clean and intuitive applications, and a strong understanding of java and programming in general</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a memory manager that simulated physical and virtual memory using paging and swapping to implement essentials of paging, including: a per-process page table, address translation, and multiple pages in memory concurrently</li>
                        <li>In addition, disc was simulated by a file that stored evicted pages that could be later swapped back into memory by the memory manager</li>
                        <li>Users could choose a process to run and request more memory, store a value in memory, or load a value from memory</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a multi-threaded simulation of a communal bathroom</li>
                        <li>Each person ran on its own individual thread, and synchronization primitives such as mutex locks and condition variables were used to prevent opposite genders from entering the bathroom at the same time</li>
                        <li>If the bathroom was male occupied, the females would wait outside until the bathroom was marked vacant by the last exiting male, then the first female would immediately enter and make the bathroom female occupied</li>
                        <li>Used condition variables to improve fairness and efficiency</li>
                        <li>Learned strategies to prevent deadlock, livelock, and race conditions</li>

                        <li>Reinterpreted an existing system call to create procAncestry</li>
                        <li>procAncestry is an executable given a PID</li>
                        <li>It will then navigate to the given PID and begin climbing its ancestral tree and return all related processes including all parents (and parents of parents), children (and children of children), and siblings</li>
